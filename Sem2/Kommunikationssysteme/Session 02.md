## Guided Transmission (Wires & Fibres)
* Media have different properties, hence performance
* Reality check
  * Storage media
* Wires
  * Twisted pairs
  * Coaxial cable
  * Power lines
* Fibre lines

### Reality check
* Send data on tape/disk/DVD for a high bandwidth link
  * Mail one box with 1,000 800 GB tapes (6,400 Tbit)
  * Takes on day to send (86,400 seconds)
  * Data rate is 70 Gbps
* Data rate is faster than long-distance networks
* Message delay is poor

### Wires
#### Twisted pair
* Very common
* Used in LANs, telephone lines
* Twists reduce radiated signal (interference)

##### Link terminology
* Full-duplex link
  * Used for transmission in both directions at once
  * E. g. use different twisted pairs for each direction
* Half-duplex link
  * Both directions, but not at the same time
  * E. g. senders take turns on a wireless channel
* Simplex link
  * Only one fixed direction at all times
  * Not common

#### Coaxial Cable ("Co-ax")
* Also common
* Better shielding and more bandwidth for longer distances and higher rates than twisted pair
* Consists of:
  * Copper core
  * Insulating material
  * Braided outer conductor
  * Protective plastc covering

#### Power lines
* Household electrical wiring is another example of wires
* Convenient to use, but horrible for sending data

#### Fiber cables
* Common for high rates and long distances
  * Long distance ISP links, Fiber-to-the-Home
  * Light carried in a very long, thin strand of glass
